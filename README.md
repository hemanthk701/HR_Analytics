# HR_Analytics
*Objective*
In this project based on employee data we predict whether that individual would get promoted or not. This can be used by the company to promote a employee or not. An R-Shiny UI was built for this project

*Modelling*
Run the Modelling.R file to get model for our prediction. Using Modelling.R file we dump two R files Data.rds and rf.rds which is then used in server.R to predict whether employee would get promoted or not. We are using random forest classifier model which is giving accuracy of 78 percent.

*User-Interface*
UI.R file gives the user interface, while the adjacent server.R connected to that is used to run the background model to predict.
